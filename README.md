# AREP First Project:

## Description of the project
- " For this project, students must build a Web server (Apache type) in Java. The server must be able to deliver HTML pages and PNG images. Likewise, the server must provide an IoC framework for building web applications from POJOS. Using the server, you must build a sample Web application and deploy it on Heroku. The server must handle multiple non-concurrent requests."

## Results
1. The source code of the project and the life cycle must be structured and managed using Maven.
2. The project must be stored in the student's GitHub account.
3. Article presenting the architecture, implementation and testing of the web server.
4. Functional prototype of your project deployed in Heroku.
